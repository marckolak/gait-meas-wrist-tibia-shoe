Measurement results for gait analysis registered with wrist, tibia and shoe sensors.

The dataset includes tri-axial acceleration and angular velocity measured during several walks using three gait sensors:
* wrist-worn,
* shoe mounted,
* strapped to a tibia.

An example how to load the set is in the `example.ipynb` notebook.

# The data are still being gathered and the dataset will soon be updated.
